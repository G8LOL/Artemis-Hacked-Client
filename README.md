# Artemis-Hacked-client (BIG SKID ONLY MADE OPEN SRC AGAIN FOR SOMEONE)
if i hear one more person call me a skidder because i skidded an open source client 2 years ago while i was learning, imma die

this is extremely skidded i made it open source so i can be transparent about this 2 year old build

none of this code is an example of my current coding skills and none of this is in new artemis
